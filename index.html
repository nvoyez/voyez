        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Heyy, I am Nick Voyez! I am 21 years old, and I am an undergraduate student at Naugatuck Valley Community College studying Software Engineering who plans on going for a master's degree! I was born in New York but grew up in New Milford my whole life. I work for Kimberly Clark in New Milford currently as a Logistics Truck Operator that pays very well.</p>

    <section id="hobbies">
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>This year I really want to add to the list of my hobbies. Currently, I love the outdoors and cannot wait for spring and summer to hit! I love working out at the gym and hanging out with friends whenever I can. I really want to learn the guitar and skateboard! I also want to get into photography as well. I also love being a foodie and would love to try various restaurants with you! I believe that music is truly therapeutic for everyone and brings people together, I love all kinds of music, and there really isn't a genre I don't like.</p>

    <section id="family-values">
        <h2>Family & Values</h2>
        <p>Family is really important to me, and I‚Äôd love to be with someone who values family just as much! Growing up only makes you realize the time you have with them lessens, and I value the time I have with them as I would with you and your family! I value commitment, respect, honesty, and transparency within a relationship as I believe those foundations are important to a healthy, and stable relationship. I also value God and the relationship I have with him and would love to know where you stand religiously :)</p>

    <section id="goals">
        <h2>Aspirations</h2>
        <p>Like I mentioned before, I really want to learn the guitar and skateboard and some photography. For my personal growth, I've been working out and building my body because these are the best years and I want to take care of it. Building my confidence is important to me and my physical health is only part of it. Regarding physical plans, mental, financial, and academic aspirations are all important to me as well. I also plan on enlisting in the Connecticut National Guard as a helicopter repairer. I consider myself pretty disciplined and a hard worker, and love the new experience. For my career, I want to stay with Kimberly Clark for 3 years at the minimum as I just started a month ago because it has given me great structure and improved my organizational skills. For my future career, I would ultimately want to become a software engineer because of how rapidly changing technology has become :)</p>
